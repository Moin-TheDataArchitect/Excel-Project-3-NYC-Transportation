I got to work with real-world data from the NYC Data website to analyze delays and breakdowns across the city's bus network. 

Here's what I uncovered:

  * Top Reasons for Delays & Breakdowns: Identified the most common issues causing delays and breakdowns.

  * Delay Trends by Bus Company & Borough: Analyzed how delays vary by different bus companies and boroughs.

  * Day of the Week Impact: Used Excel's WEEKDAY function to explore if certain days of the week have more delays or breakdowns.
    
I got hands-on with pivot tables, filters, and even created new columns to track the data better. 

I also used bar charts and line charts to visually present my findings and draw some conclusions.
